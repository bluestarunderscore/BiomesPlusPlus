## What is Biomes++/BiomesPlusPlus?
Biomes++ (or BPP) is a Fabric port of Environs++ for 1.20.4 and possibly beyond. Environs++ added biomes which stayed true to the style of vanilla biomes at the time, but the mod and its biomes became outdated with the release of 1.18.

## What Will Biomes++ Include?
BPP's initial beta builds will have the feature set of 1.12.2-1.0, with no pine-related features or sub-biomes that became redundant with 1.18's generator changes. The full 1.20.4 release will be equivalent to 1.12.2-1.5.

## When Will Beta Builds Start?
The plan for the first BPP alpha/beta builds is the tail-end of March.

## Forge When?
No
