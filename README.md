## What is Biomes++/BiomesPlusPlus?
Biomes++ (or BPP) is a Fabric port of Environs++ for 1.20.4 and possibly beyond. Environs++ added biomes which stayed true to the style of vanilla biomes at the time, but the mod and its biomes became outdated with the release of 1.18.

## What Will Biomes++ Include?
Biomes++ b1.1 has a feature set equivalent to 1.12.2-1.4, with no pine-related features or sub-biomes that became redundant with 1.18's generator changes. The full 1.20.4 release will be equivalent to 1.12.2-1.5. Some new biomes will be added as well, most notably mountain biome variations.

## Forge When?
